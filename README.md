Hi, we are Tobias, Sascha, and Florian, and we are eager to learn more about data science. 

For our data science project, we intend to predict house prices from web-scraped data. 

Our project involves several stages, including data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and model evaluation. We will be using Python and its powerful libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn to carry out our analyses.

The goal of this project is not only to build a model that can accurately predict house prices, but also to understand the factors that influence these prices. We believe that this understanding can provide valuable insights for both buyers and sellers in the real estate market.

We're excited to embark on this journey and look forward to sharing our findings. Stay tuned for updates!
