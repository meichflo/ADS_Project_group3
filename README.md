## 🎯 Project Overview

In this project, our voyage is set towards **predicting house prices from web-scraped data**. Our journey is marked by several milestones:

- **Data Collection:** Sailing across the internet to gather precious data.
- **Data Cleaning:** Polishing our treasure to make it shine.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Mapping the depths of our dataset to uncover hidden gems.
- **Feature Engineering:** Crafting the tools needed for our adventure.
- **Model Building:** Constructing the vessel that will lead us to our destination.
- **Model Evaluation:** Testing the integrity and performance of our creation.

We're armed with Python and its mighty libraries—**Pandas** for our logbooks, **NumPy** for our calculations, and **Scikit-learn** for our navigation tools.
